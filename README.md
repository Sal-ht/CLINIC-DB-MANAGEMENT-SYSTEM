🚀 How to Run/Setup the Project:
To set up the Clinic Booking System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Database Setup:
Make sure you have MySQL installed on your system. You can download it from MySQL Downloads.

Open MySQL Workbench or any MySQL client that you prefer.

2. Import SQL File:
Create a new database in MySQL. For example, you can create it with this command:


CREATE DATABASE Clinic_db;

Once the database is created, you can import the SQL script.
This will create all the necessary tables, relationships, and constraints for the Clinic Booking System.

3. Start Using the Database:
Now that the database and tables are set up, you can start inserting data and performing queries to manage appointments, prescriptions, patients, and more.

⚙️ Dependencies:
MySQL for database management.
